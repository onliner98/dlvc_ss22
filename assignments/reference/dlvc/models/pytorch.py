    Wrapper around a PyTorch CNN for classification.
    The network must expect inputs of shape NCHW with N being a variable batch size,

    The network must end with a linear layer with num_classes units (no softmax).
    The cross-entropy loss (torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss) and SGD (torch.optim.SGD) are used for training.

        net is the cnn to wrap. see above comments for requirements.
        input_shape is the expected input shape, i.e. (0,C,H,W).
