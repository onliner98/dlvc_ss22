    Dataset of cat and dog images from CIFAR-10 (class 0: cat, class 1: dog).

        '''
        Loads a subset of the dataset from a directory fdir that contains the Python version
        of the CIFAR-10, i.e. files "data_batch_1", "test_batch" and so on.
        Raises ValueError if fdir is not a directory or if a file inside it is missing.

        The subsets are defined as follows:
          - The training set contains all cat and dog images from "data_batch_1" to "data_batch_4", in this order.
          - The validation set contains all cat and dog images from "data_batch_5".
          - The test set contains all cat and dog images from "test_batch".

        Images are loaded in the order the appear in the data files
        and returned as uint8 numpy arrays with shape (32, 32, 3), in BGR channel order.
